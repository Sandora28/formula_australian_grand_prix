Project is about formula 1 results prediction.
First of all , i have start to get results from last year australian grand prix , for which i used fast f1.
Then i am filtering this data based on mostly neede properties for prediction.
After i have splitted data to train and test data.
also for predictions i used 2026 australian grand prix qualifying times and predict race times. after all i have compared real and 
my predicted data to each other.
